// [ ]: Svelte with customizable slots components that affects the spring or tween animation

// NOTE: stiffness (number, default 0.15) — a value between 0 and 1 where higher means a 'tighter' spring
// NOTE: damping (number, default 0.8) — a value between 0 and 1 where lower means a 'springier' spring
// NOTE: precision (number, default 0.01) — determines the threshold at which the spring is considered to have 'settled', where lower means more precise

// COMMENT: https://medium.com/@bjorn.holdt/react-motion-101-springs-336f4f29d95a#:~:text=Stiffness%20and%20damping%20to%20change%20animation&text=Stiffness%20defines%20how%20strong%20the,different%20feel%20to%20an%20animation.

// COMMENT: Stiffness defines how strong the object is pulled towards its final value.

// COMMENT: Damping is the friction the object will encounter as it gets pulled towards its target.

// COMMENT: Changing these two values will result in a completely different feel to an animation.
